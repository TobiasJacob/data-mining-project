\section{Preprocessing steps}
The dataset measures 967 MB in size and contains multiple tables.
We are most interested in the Player, PlayerAttributes, Team, and Game table with 5, 37, 7, and 149 columns, respectively.
Our goal is to build an interesting data cube that allows us to answer multiple questions.
It should contain the following dimensions and concept hierarchies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player, Team
    \item Game, Season
    \item Place
    \item Time
\end{itemize}
The value should be ``Points scored'' and ``Attempted point scores''. We are also interested in the following properties of players: Size, Salary.
