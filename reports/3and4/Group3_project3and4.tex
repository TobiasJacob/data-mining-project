\section{Data mining}

We used a script to infer rules.
A rule is recognized as a rule if the conditional entropy given the fact is below 1.

\begin{lstlisting}
if HEIGHT=Short, then the player has WEIGHT=['Light']. Conf: 51%
if HEIGHT=Middle, then the player has WEIGHT=['Middle']. Conf: 81%
if HEIGHT=Tall, then the player has WEIGHT=['Heavy']. Conf: 71%
if HEIGHT=Short, then the player has ACTIVE_YEARS=['Short']. Conf: 92%
if HEIGHT=Middle, then the player has ACTIVE_YEARS=['Short']. Conf: 98%
if WEIGHT=Light, then the player has HEIGHT=['Short']. Conf: 55%
if WEIGHT=Middle, then the player has HEIGHT=['Middle']. Conf: 93%
if WEIGHT=Heavy, then the player has HEIGHT=['Tall']. Conf: 51%
if WEIGHT=Light, then the player has ACTIVE_YEARS=['Short']. Conf: 91%
if WEIGHT=Middle, then the player has ACTIVE_YEARS=['Short']. Conf: 99%
if PTS=LessScores, then the player has ACTIVE_YEARS=['Short']. Conf: 50%
if PTS=ManyScores, then the player has ACTIVE_YEARS=['Long']. Conf: 83%
if ACTIVE_YEARS=Short, then the player has PTS=['LessScores']. Conf: 85%
\end{lstlisting}
There are some wrong interferences, because the probability of a player having ``ACTIVE\_YEARS == Short'' is very high in general.
A better measure is therefore the information gain.
The information gain tells us, how much more we know about the output distribution, given the fact.
\begin{lstlisting}
if HEIGHT=Short, then the probability of WEIGHT = ['Light'] increases, and WEIGHT = ['Middle' 'Heavy'] decreases. Conf: 55%
if HEIGHT=Middle, then the probability of WEIGHT = ['Middle'] increases, and WEIGHT = ['Light' 'Heavy'] decreases. Conf: 25%
if HEIGHT=Tall, then the probability of WEIGHT = ['Heavy'] increases, and WEIGHT = ['Light' 'Middle'] decreases. Conf: 35%
if WEIGHT=Light, then the probability of HEIGHT = ['Short'] increases, and HEIGHT = ['Middle' 'Tall'] decreases. Conf: 54%
if WEIGHT=Middle, then the probability of HEIGHT = ['Middle'] increases, and HEIGHT = ['Short' 'Tall'] decreases. Conf: 16%
if WEIGHT=Heavy, then the probability of HEIGHT = ['Tall'] increases, and HEIGHT = ['Short' 'Middle'] decreases. Conf: 58%
if PTS=LessScores, then the probability of ACTIVE_YEARS = ['Short'] increases, and ACTIVE_YEARS = ['Middle' 'Long'] decreases. Conf: 50%
if PTS=ManyScores, then the probability of ACTIVE_YEARS = ['Long'] increases, and ACTIVE_YEARS = ['Short'] decreases. Conf: 17%
if ACTIVE_YEARS=Short, then the probability of PTS = ['LessScores'] increases, and PTS = ['MiddleScores' 'MoreScores' 'ManyScores'] decreases. Conf: 36%
\end{lstlisting}
